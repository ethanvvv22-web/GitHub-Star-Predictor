🚀 GitHub Star Prediction System (ML Pipeline + Flask API)

📌 Overview

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning system to predict GitHub repository stars. It combines a modular ML pipeline with a Flask-based API for real-time prediction and ranking.

The system is designed with a layered architecture, covering data processing, model training, inference, and deployment.

🚀 Key Features

📊 End-to-end ML pipeline (preprocess → train → evaluate)

🤖 Model selection based on validation performance (R²)

⚙️ Configuration-driven design (model-aware preprocessing)

🧠 Dedicated inference layer for prediction logic

🌐 REST API for prediction and ranking

🎨 Interactive web interface

🐳 Dockerized deployment

🧠 System Design

The project follows a layered machine learning system architecture:

Data Layer → Training Layer → Inference Layer → Application Layer

🔹 Data Layer
Handles data preprocessing and feature engineering
Implemented in preprocess.py

🔹 Training Layer
Trains and evaluates multiple models
Selects the best model based on R² score
Implemented in train_models.py and evaluate.py

🔹 Inference Layer ⭐
Loads model and scaler
Applies consistent preprocessing to inputs
Encapsulates prediction logic for reuse
Implemented in:
inference_utils.py
model_config.py
inference_test.py

🔹 Application Layer
Exposes prediction services via Flask API
Provides a simple web UI
Implemented in app.py

🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

The training workflow consists of three main steps:

python preprocess.py
python train_model.py
python evaluate.py
Data is cleaned and transformed
Multiple models can be trained
The best model is selected based on validation R² score

📦 Model Artifacts

After training, the following files are required for inference:

app/model/
├── best_model.joblib

├── scaler.joblib

├── best_model_metadata.json

model → performs prediction

scaler → ensures consistent input preprocessing

metadata → stores model information (R², model type, etc.)

🌐 API Endpoints
